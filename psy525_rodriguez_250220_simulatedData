## Hypothesis
Racial preference attitudes (White preference over Black) is positively correlated with uncomfortability with being around Black people (social distance).

## Variables
```{r}
sample_n <- 1000
beta0 <- 5
beta1 <- .7

sigma <- 3

distance <- runif(n = sample_n, min = 0, max = 10)

bias_pred <- rep(x = beta0, n = sample_n) + beta1 * distance
bias <- bias_pred + rnorm(n = sample_n, mean = 0, sd = sigma)

```
## Histogram Charts
```{r}

library(stats)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

hist(distance)
hist(bias)
hist(bias_pred)
```

## ggplot2
```{r}
bias_distance <- data.frame(bias, distance)

scatter_1 <- ggplot2::ggplot(data = bias_distance) +
  ggplot2::aes(x = bias, distance) +
  ggplot2::geom_point()
scatter_1
```
